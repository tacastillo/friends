Running through a shuffled corpus of every line said by a character through IBM Watson&#39;s Personality Insights API, I was given back three dozen personality traits deduced from the text. The most interesting analysis out of all of this was that, based on what they say, all of the friends have very similar similarities, with almost always a tight standard deviation. This means that the scripts of Friends are probably a more accurate portrayal of the writers than of the actual characters. Of course, some intent towards having certain personality had shown through, and these are plotted on the above radar charts.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default Personalities;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/Personalities.js","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Chart from \"./Chart\";\nimport { toTitleCase, round, toComma, color } from \"./constants.js\";\n\nimport './stylesheets/Talkative.css';\n\nlet Waypoint = require('react-waypoint');\n\nlet data = require('../analytics/data/most-talkative.json')\n\nclass Talkative extends Component {\n\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n        let median = data.shift().words;\n        let {newData, sum}  = this._adjustScale(data);\n        this.state = {\n            data: {\n                children: newData,\n\t        },\n\t        median: median,\n\t        total: sum,\n            inView: false\n        }\n    }\n\n    _adjustScale(data) {\n    \tlet sum = 0;\n    \tlet adjusted = data.map((value) => {\n    \t\tsum += value.words;\n    \t\treturn {\n    \t\t\tname: value.name,\n    \t\t\tscaledWords: (1 + (value.frequency * 3)) * value.words,\n    \t\t\twords: value.words\n    \t\t}\n    \t});\n    \treturn {\n    \t\tnewData: adjusted,\n    \t\tsum: sum\n    \t}\n    }\n\n    _updateDetail = (data) => {\n    \tdata.name = data.name || \"\";\n    \tthis.setState(() => {\n    \t\treturn {\n    \t\t\tcurrentName: toTitleCase(data.name) || \"\",\n    \t\t\tcurrentWords: data.words,\n    \t\t\tcurrentPercent: round(data.words/this.state.total*100, 2)\n    \t\t}\n    \t});\n    }\n\n    _scroll = () => {\n        this.setState(() => {\n            return {inView: !this.state.inView};\n        });\n    }\n\n    render() {\n    \tlet currentName = this.state.currentName ? `${toComma(this.state.currentName)} said` : '';\n    \tlet currentWords = this.state.currentWords ? `${toComma(this.state.currentWords)} words` : '';\n    \tlet currentPercent = !isNaN(this.state.currentPercent) ? `(${this.state.currentPercent}%)` : ''\n        return (\n        \t<div className=\"talkative page\">\n\t        \t<h1>The One Who Talks Too Much</h1>\n                <h4>Hover over each friend to see how much each character talks</h4>\n                <Waypoint\n                    onEnter={this._scroll}\n                    onLeave={this._scroll}\n                    topOffset={\"70%\"}\n                    bottomOffset={\"70%\"}>\n    \t        \t<div className=\"chart-container\">\n    \t        \t\t<div className=\"bubble-stats\">\n    \t        \t\t\t<h3 className=\"bubble-stat\">{currentName}</h3>\n    \t        \t\t\t<h3 className=\"bubble-stat\">{currentWords}</h3>\n    \t        \t\t\t<h3 className=\"bubble-stat\">{currentPercent}</h3>\n    \t        \t\t</div>\n    \t\t            <Chart\n    \t\t                type={\"bubble\"}\n    \t\t                height={750}\n    \t\t                width={750}\n                            inView={this.state.inView}\n    \t\t                updateDetail={this._updateDetail}\n                            color={color}\n    \t\t                data={this.state.data}\n    \t\t            />\n    \t            </div>\n                </Waypoint>\n                <div className=\"caption-container\">\n                    <p className=\"caption\">\n                        Now, first things first: who talks the most, and thus, who is Friends <b>REALLY</b> about?
